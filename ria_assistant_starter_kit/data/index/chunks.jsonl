It specifies requirements around the minimisation of transmission of communicable diseases through the use of therapeutic goods comprising, derived from or containing HCT , as set out in the Therapeutic Goods (Standard for Human Cell and Tissue Products – Donor Screening Requirements) (TGO 108) Order 2021 , which came into effect 30 September 2021 . Therapeutic Goods Orders ( TGOs ) are standards that determine the consistency of product quality, i ncluding label quality. As a provider of such therapeutic goods , you must comply with requirements that contribute to the ir quality and safety, and that mitigate infectious disease risks. TGO 108 replaces: • Therapeutic Goods Order No. 8 8 - Standards for donor selection, testing and minimising infectious disease transmission via therapeutic goods that are human blood and blood components, human tissues and human cellular therapy products (TGO 8 8) TGO 88 was due to ‘sunset’ on 1 October 2023. Sunsetting is the process whereby legislative instruments undergo automatic repeal after 10 years following their registration. TGA updated TGO 88 at the same time as numerous other TGOs which sunsetted on 1 October 2021 because all these TGOs were inter -related and cross -referenced each other: • Therapeutic Goods Order No. 83 - Standards for human musculoskeletal tissue (TGO 83) • Therapeutic Goods Order No. 84 - Standards for human cardiovascular tissue (TGO 84) • Therapeutic Goods Order No. 85 - Standards for human ocular tissue (TGO 85) • Therapeutic Goods Order No. 86 - Standards for human skin (TGO 86) This information is provided for guidance only and has been developed based on current knowledge of the subject matter.

Part 1 – Preliminary Section 4 – Definitions The definitions provided within TGO 108 are specific to this TGO and are not intended to apply outside of TGO 108. Please see TGO 108 for definitions. Where possible, definitions included in TGA’s Acronyms & glossary page are derived from current TGA legislation, international regulatory documents, or current industry guidance documents. Where a suitable definition has not been identified by those means, TGA has developed a definition that is informed by equivalent terms used in the aforementioned documents, expert committees, or through public consultation. Further clarification of some definitions, specific to TGO 108, are provided below. allogeneic use , in relation to an HCT product, means administration to, or application in the treatment of, a person other than the person from whom the HCT materials used in the manufacture of the product were collected. This definition intends to capture all non -self- transplantation or transfusion, and includes syngeneic use (for example, between identical twins). asystole , in relation to a donor of HCT materials, means the reference time for cardiac arrest, which is determined as follows: the documented pronounced time of death; or if death is not witnessed – the last time the donor was known to be alive; or the tissue donor is also a solid organ donor – the cross -clamp time. This definition includes cross- clamp time, which for organ donors refers to the time that the aorta is cross clamped by a surgical team. A documented pronounced time of death is used as asystole when life -saving procedures have been attempted and there were signs of, or documentation of, recent life (for example, agonal respirations, pulse -less electrical activity). The time of certification of circulatory death would be considered appropriate if the tissue donor is also a solid organ donor.

Part 2 – Requirements Part 2 specifies the minimum standards for samples and test methods used for infectious disease testing for determining donor suitability. Section 9 – General requirements Subsections 9(1) to 9(3) – Manufacture 9 General requirements 1. An HCT product must be manufactured in accordance with procedures that mitigate the risk of infectious disease transmission. 2. An HCT product must not be released for supply, unless the applicable screening procedures and requirements specified in this instrument are satisfied. 3. Acceptance criteria based on microbial specifications must be applied to HCT materials used in the manufacture of an HCT product. All manufacturers must ensure that the design and construction of the manufacturing facility is suitable to the type of processing conducted, with separation of areas for minimising cross - contamination. Design and develop the facility and procedures , taking into account the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP ) if the manufacture of an HCT product takes place in a hospital. Where a facility holds a TGA manufacturing licence, complying with the requirements of the Australian Code of GMP achieves compliance with the requirements outlined in this subsection. Guidance is available to assist facilities on how the Australian Code of GMP applies to the manufacture of HCT products. All HCT products and materials must be segregated from the mainstream inventory until the HCT product has been determined to be compliant with all necessary requirements or release criteria. This is especially relevant for products stored in an inventory (or banked) with other products for potentially long periods of time . These products pose a risk of transmission to other products through physical contact, and a risk to the public from unintentional release and use. Quarantine procedures are assessable under the current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements.

Consider utilising new test methods, such as more sensitive assays, as they become available. When testing a sample of cadaveric blood, the screening test must be specifically approved for use on cadaveric specimens or validated for this purpose by the testing laboratory. Approval of test kits If the test kit and methodology has current approval by the relevant regulatory authority in the country where the testing is performed, the evidence of this approval should be provided. Where test methods are used beyond the level approved by the local regulatory approval, for example, use on cadaveric samples, validation to support the extended use must be demonstrated. A well -characterised assay already established for blood donors may be used for testing cadaveric specimens. Alternative methods to characterise a cadaveric assay may be acceptable to TGA and the supporting validation data should be provided for review wit h the application. Testing facility All facilities performing donor testing must be approved by the regulatory authority in the country where the testing is performed. For domestic facilities, a TGA licence will be required. For overseas testing facilities, the sponsor must hold a TGA clearance demonstrating compliance with GMP requirements. Where confirmatory testing is utilised to decide suitability of a donor, the facility’s GMP must include this purpose. Acceptance of testing kits Sponsors are encouraged to contact TGA’s Biological Science Section (BSS) as to the acceptability of test kits. Test kits used domestically for donor screening should meet the requirements of the IVD regulatory framework . Testing facilities in Australia would also need a GMP licence from TGA.

Subsections 9(7) and 9(8) – Plasma dilution 9 General requirements 7. The testing of blood samples must take into account all factors that may cause plasma dilution. 8. Where plasma dilution is suspected at a level sufficient to alter the test results in relation to a blood sample, and a pre- infusion sample is unavailable for testing, then: an algorithm must be applied to assess the extent of plasma dilution; and the extent of plasma dilution must be less than 50 per cent, unless use of samples with more than 50 per cent plasma dilution is validated by the manufacturer of the IVD medical devices or in -house IVD medical devices used for testing the sample. Consider all factors that may cause plasma dilution when testing of blood samples. The results of infectious disease testing may be affected where a potential donor may have recently received an intravenous treatment, for example infusion of blood componen ts, colloids, or crystalloids. Undertake a complete haemodilution assessment on all living and deceased donors for infectious disease test screening protocols. Plasma dilution algorithms may be used to calculate appropriate amounts. If the infusion or transfusion volume for the donor totals more than 2000 mL, it is considered essential that a haemodilution assessment be performed if: • an infusion or transfusion of blood or colloids was received within 48 hours preceding collection of the sample or within 48 hours preceding death, whichever occurred earlier • an infusion of crystalloids was received within one hour preceding collection of the sample, or within one hour preceding death, whichever occurred earlier • a combination of blood, crystalloids or colloids was received within the applicable timeframes It is essential that an assessment", "version_id": "6ed8cb52843e8702", "ingested_at": 1760488324}

This requirement is in place to allow a manufacturer the ability to conduct reviews of the infectious disease status of donors, or conduct additional tests if donor selection and deferral criteria change during product storage. Failure to store a sample or loss of sample is a ‘non -conformance’ and should follow internal non- conformance procedures. This may be subject to review during GMP inspection. Retesting of archived samples If there are changes to donor deferral during product storage (which may be for several years after the completion of processing), the archived donor blood sample may need to be re- tested based on these changes.

For HCV, an uninfected state can be established if an individual had undergone successful anti-viral treatment, and the individual has been shown to be HCV negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) over a period. For HBV, if a patient previously infected with HBV is Hepatitis B surface antibody positive (with or without core antibody positivity), but negative for both Hepatitis B surface antigen and HBV DNA, then they may be re -eligible to donate. Demonstration of exposure versus immunity to HBV must be determined by a testing algorithm that is informed from evidence in scientific literature or other reliable sources, as above. For example, donors suspected of being infected with HBV who are HBsAg negative are consi dered ‘immune’ if both of the following apply: • they have an antibody titre to HBsAg at a level greater than or equal to 10 IU/L (or 10 mIU/mL) AND • HBV NAT is negative Donors suspected of being infected with HBV, who are HBsAg negative, are considered to be ‘not exposed’ if they test negative for antibodies to HBsAg and test negative by HBV NAT. For HBsAg negative persons who are demonstrated to be immune or never exposed, no ineligibility period applies.

It is the responsibility of the sponsor to demonstrate that a process is in p lace to monitor, assess and action epidemiological situations relevant to their products. In the case of the COVID- 19 disease pandemic, a manufacturer will need to monitor advice on the risk of infection to the safety of their product and consider how to manage the risk through deferral of donors (and potentially testing). For travel -based deferrals, a documented procedure must be in place to record the countries where crucial infectious diseases are endemic or where there is an outbreak. The deferral may be based on a country of travel, or where an agent is endemic to a local area within that country. WHO publishes a list of countries where specific diseases such as malaria, Zika virus, Dengue fever, Ebola virus disease, West Nile Virus (WNV) are present.

The definition of endemic region may be at the country level, or it may be possible to justify more specifically local areas within any one particular country. The concept of having ‘visited’ a malaria endemic region is to be applied as consistent with WHO guidelines. In the case of malaria, visitation includes any situation where the donor has been potentially exposed to the external environment. For example, it would not include a stop -over in an airport terminal where the individual did not leave the terminal, but would include if the donor were to travel to another location (including another terminal) in a bus or private taxi. Malarial prophylaxis does not af fect the malaria ineligibility periods. TGA acknowledges that clearance of malarial parasites from HCT materials could be an alternative to this requirement. Recognising the sensitivity of the malaria parasite to gamma irradiation, HCT material subjected to irradiation with ≥ 25 kGy during manuf acture of the HCT product appears sufficient to clear malaria parasites. Similarly, if the HCT product from such a donor will be terminally sterilised, the risk of malaria transmission is likely low. Thus donors who have had potential exposure to malaria may be accepted without any deferral period if the HCT material will, during manufacture, have additional treatments of either: • a terminal sterilisation process during manufacture of the HCT product, which must be validated to ensure a maximal sterility assurance level of 10 -6 • ≥ 25 kGy of gamma irradiation as an additional manufacturing step", "version_id": "6ed8cb52843e8702", "ingested_at": 1760488324}

This involves challenging the material or product with low numbers (< 100 CFU) of reference challenge microorganisms and recovering these organisms within the shortest test incubation time. Given that antimicrobial agents could be present in the starting materials and/or the end HCT product, it is necessary to attempt to neutralise these agents to optimise the recovery of the challenge microorganisms, and any product contaminants. Pharmacopoeial and ISO methods mandate this step under ‘ suitability of test method’ or ‘method validation’. Antimicrobial activity can often be removed by filtration, dilution and/or chemical inactivation using a suitable neutralising agent.

Section 22 – Demineralised products 22 Dem ineralised products The residual calcium of human musculoskeletal tissue products that are demineralised must not exceed 8% w/w. For a bone product to be classified as demineralised, it must have a reduction in calcium levels. This specification is adopte d from the American Association for Tissue Banks (AATB) guidance which mandates residual calcium levels for demineralised bone products. Unless bone is treated by a validated process to reduce minerals, test representative samples of eac h lot for residual calcium using a validated standard method. Residual calcium content for bone labelled as ‘demineralised’ shall not exceed 8% w/w according to a standard method. For bone that has been subje cted to a demineralisation process with a residual calcium content target that exceeds 8% w/w when tested, the tissue must not be labelled as ‘demineralised’. Labelled as ‘partially demineralised’ to describe the extent of demineralisation. Some demineral ised bone may claim osteoinductive properties. Do not make an osteoinductive claim unless the osteoinductive potential of the product has been demonstrated by a validated test method.

Human skin must be sampled for bioburden testing following collection and prior to being packaged. 2. Processing of human skin must commence: (a) within 24 hours of collection; or (b) within a longer timeframe that is validated by the manufacturer to prevent microbial proliferation and to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of the human skin product manufactured using the human skin. This section specifies the bioburden sampling and packaging requirements for collected skin. Validate both sampling and packaging processes to demonstrate compliance with TGO 109. Unless the entire tissue product is subject to bioburden testing, validate that a sample or portion is representative of the entire tissue. Sample from a variety of areas across the tissue during sampling validation studies and compare the bioburden test results. Take subsequent routine bioburden samples from any area which represents the ‘worst case’ in terms of bioburden. Commence tissue processing within 24 hours of procurement. Before processing, keep the recovered skin in a temperature -controlled refrigerator at 2- 8°C, without interruption throughout the refrigeration process. It is recommended to change cell nutrient medium used for viable grafts shortly after receipt of skin grafts, or that you validate the medium for 24 hours storage (that is, adequate buffering capacity). Perform all the manipulations where the transport containers are going to be exposed and the media changed in a controlled -air environment. It should be noted that ‘commencement of processing’ is a broad term that may include the commencement of the bioburden reduction step in processing (addition of antimicrobial compounds) as required by Part 6.

Unless otherwise specified, a biological to which this Part applies must meet the general requirements in Part 2 in addition to the specific requirements in this Part. Part 7 applies to biologicals that are human amnion. This part ensures that amnion is manufactured to a minimum level and improves consistency of these therapeutic goods in Australia. Section 45 – Application of this Part 45 Application of this Part This Part applies in relation to human amnion products that have been subjected to only minimal manipulation. Minimal manipulation is defined by TGA here: • TGA guidance: Method of preparation: Interpretation of minimal manipulation Section 46 – Collection 46 Collection 1. Human amnion used in the manufacture of human amnion products must be collected as soon as possible after caesarean section or vaginal delivery. 2. Processing of the human amnion must commence: (a) within 24 hours of collection; or (b) within a longer timeframe that is validated by the manufacturer to prevent microbial proliferation and to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of the human amnion product manufactured using the human amnion. The Council of Europe’s 4th Edition of the Guide to the quality and safety of tissues and cells for human application (2019) states that vaginal delivery of amnion rather than collection via caesarean section in a surgical environment can introduce vaginal microflora to the starting tissue.

Staff undertaking procurement must be dressed appropriately for the procedure to minimise the risk of contamination of the procured tissue and any h azard to themselves. Procurement under aseptic conditions after elective caesarean section is preferred, as amnion collected following vaginal delivery can be contaminated by normal vaginal flora. Sterilise the processed product, if procured during vagina l delivery. Use a validated sterilisation method to achieve a SAL of 10 -6 and ensure that any contaminating microflora is eliminated. Commence processing as soon as possible after collection, with a maximum time of 24 hours. From collection to processing, store in a suitable transport/decontamination medium to preserve the structural and biological properties of the amniotic membrane. Section 47 – Terminal sterilisation 47 Terminal sterilisation Human amnion products manufactured using human amnion collect ed following vaginal delivery must be terminally sterilised in accordance with section 14. If the product is to be terminally sterilised, perform validation and routine control of sterilisation processes in accordance with the relevant parts of internatio nal sterilisation standards, for example: • ISO 11135 (ethylene oxide) • ISO 14937 (general methods) • ISO 17665 (moist heat) • ISO 11137 (radiation) • ISO 14160 (chemical sterilisation) • ISO 20857 (dry heat) Some of these standards are relevant to the sterilisation of containers and ancillary materials used during tissue processing. Use sterile containers. Any of the ISO standards listed above provide guidance for validating the relevant sterilisation process for containers. Containers can also be pre-p urchased as sterile.

PURPOSE AND INTRODUCTION TO THE GUIDELINE 1.1 The purpose of the Guideline for the Preparation of Technical Master Files for Blood, Blood Components and Haematopoietic Progenitor Cells 2008 (‘the Guideline’) is to guide manufacturers in the development of Technical Master Files (TMF) relevant to blood, blood components and haematopoietic progenitor cells. The Guideline describes the scope and information expected in a TMF to demonstrate the safety and quality of blood, blood components and haematopoietic progenitor cells. 1.2 The purpose of a TMF is to provide information to the Secretary of the Department of Health and delegates of the Secretary in the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for review. It provides a medium for a manufacturer to demonstrate how appropriate standards for product safety and quality have been met by the organisation. The TMF should include sufficient information to indicate that blood, blood components or haematopoietic progenitor cells will be manufactured in compliance with relevant standards as specified by the TGA. 1.3 The structure of technical information in the TMF to be submitted to the TGA can either follow the Suggested Content of the Guidel ine or, where a specific standard is mandated, the TGA strongly recommends that manufacturers provide an overarching description of their activities as a preface to the presentation of information and data according to the structure of the relevant mandated standard. Guidance may be drawn from Section 7 of this Guideline for any supplementary depth to information. 1.4 The Therapeutic Goods (Manufacturing Principles) Determination No. 1 of 2007 (MP1/2007) made under Section 36 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (‘the Act’) sets out the principles for the manufacture of blood, blood components, plasma, and haematopoietic progenitor cells for use in humans. Division 2 of the Manufacturing Principles includes the requirement for manufacturers of blood, blood components and haematopoietic progenitor cells to lodge a TMF with an application for a manufacturing licence. 1.5 A TMF is: (a) a compilation of scientific data provided by a manufacturer which includes a description of the steps of manufacture consistent with the Guideline recommendations; and (b) detailed techn ical and scien tific data or information that must satisfy the", "version_id": "0ef6a7ec49ac3fbd", "ingested_at": 1760488327}

It is acknowledged that there can be acceptable alternatives conformi ng to the same end and retaining compliance with applicable guidelines and standards. Applications may describe alternative methods and procedures, but these should be justified and validated to confirm relevance for inclusion in the TMF. The manufacturer bears the ultimate responsibility for the products it manufactures. 1.8 Comments on the Guideline are invited at any stage in the life of this edition. The Guideline is available on the TGA website at http://www.tga.gov.au 2. RELEVANT DOCUMENTS Many of the documents mentioned above can be obtained from the TGA website http://www.tga.gov.au . 3. SUBMISSION OF A TMF 3.1 A manufacturer of blood, blood components, plasma or haematopoietic progenitor cells is required to submit a relevant TMF with its application for a licence to manufacture. 3.2 Initial TMFs should be submitted together with a photocopy of the ‘Application for a Licence to Manufacture Therapeutic Goo ds’. 3.3 TMFs (initial, variations and annual updates) should be submitted as three paper copies and an electronic version of the TMF. The electronic version should be submitted on a compact disc and forwarded with the paper copies. 3.4 The form at Attachment A should be submitted with variations and annual updates to the TMF. The form is also available via the TGA internet page. 3.5 All TMF submissions should be forwarded to: Administration Officer, Blood and Tissues Unit Office of Devices, Blood and Tissues Therapeutic Goods Administration Department of Health and Ageing PO Box 100 MDP 122 WODEN ACT 2606", "version_id": "0ef6a7ec49ac3fbd", "ingested_at": 1760488327}

FEES 5.1 A Licence Appl ication Fee is payable at the time of making an Application for a Licence to Manufacture. Additional fees are usually levied on an organisation for the evaluation of a TMF and for audit costs. (Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990, Schedule 9). http://www.tga.gov.au/about/fees.htm 5.2 An evaluation fee for the TMF submission may not be levied on an organisation that can substantiate eligibility for exemption from such fees. (Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, Section 59(3)). http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/all/search/652780 38011B7DF3CA257375000D669B 5.3 Fees are charged for TMF annual updates for those agencies not covered by Section 59(3) of the Act. 5.4 Fees are also charged for audits of manufacturers to assess compliance with the Australian Code of GMP for Blood and Tissues. 6. CHANGES TO A TMF 6.1 After a TMF has been determined to be satisfactory by the TGA delegate it represents the agreed manufacturing conditions for that product or products. As such, the manufacturing conditions and the TMF cannot be changed without notification to, or approval by, the TGA delegate. The TGA accepts that changes to the manufacturing conditions will occur from time to time. 6.2 To assist the TGA in approving changes, each submitting manufacturer is requested to include in the TMF: (a) a summary of changes between the previous version and the updated version, and", "version_id": "0ef6a7ec49ac3fbd", "ingested_at": 1760488327}

This documentation should include a description of the changes, a description of how the effect of these changes on product quality will be assessed, and describe how the changes will be implemented, documented and validated. The documentation should describe, but not be limited to, the procedures to be used when introducing changes to a starting material, product c omponent, processing equipment, method of production or testing. 6.3 The TGA considers that changes fall into three categories which are listed below. (a). Changes requiring pre approval by the TGA. These include changes to manufacturing processes or co nditions which have a significant potential to impact on the quality and safety of the product. These may include changes to infectious disease product release testing and changes to manufacturing conditions such as the introduction of new technologies or changes to manufacturing parameters. Such changes need regulatory approval from the TGA prior to implementation. Requests for such changes should be submitted in writing to the TGA and should include a justification for the change and supporting documenta tion, such as protocol(s) and validation report(s). A GMP audit may be required prior to the introduction of changes to critical steps of manufacture. (b). Changes requiring notification to the TGA A change requiring TGA notification is one that may have an effect on quality and/or safety of the product. These changes require notification to the TGA preferably before the change is implemented. Requests for such changes should be submitted in writing to the TGA and should include a justification. The TGA ma y request additional information regarding the changes such as data and validation reports. Examples could include change to reagents used within an established assay. (c). Changes which only require incorporation into a TMF update . A change only requiring incorporation into the TMF is not likely to have a detectable impact on the quality or safety of the product. For example, “like - for-like” equipment replacement (e.g. replacement of one centrifuge with another centrifuge) would be unlikely to affect the manufacturing process if the change control mechanism is implemented satisfactorily.

Manufacturing Licensing requirements are set out in Part 3 -3 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and include requirements to comply with both general and specific conditions of licence. It is a condition of licence that, Blood, Tissue and Cellular Therapy Products manufacturers observe the Manufacturing Pr inciples determined under Section 36 of the Act. The Manufacturing Principles require these manufacturers to demonstrate that manufacturing practices comply with the Australian Code of Good Manufacturing Practice for Human Blood and Blood Components, Human Tissues and Human Cellular Therapy Products. The TGA Manufacturing Regulator in consultation with Medsafe NZ and the Australian and New Zealand Human Blood and Human Tissue manufacturers undertook the revision of the Code. The structure of the document has been changed and is written in a less prescriptive style. It describes the way in which Human Blood and Blood components, Human Tissues and Human Cellular Therapies should be manufactured to ensure that they consistently meet specifications and are safe to use. Therapeutic Goods Orders (TGOs) are established separately which set out specifications addressing product safety and efficacy. Manufacturers are required to develop dossiers for product groups to demonstrate that these TGOs are met. This Code do es not intend to deal with common or statute law requirements, such as Occupational Health and Safety, or the requirements for building construction. It is not intended that the Code be used to replace procedures that are already in place, but that it be used to ensure that procedures in place meet the requirements of the Code. The Code sets out all the requirements for good manufacturing practice (GMP), which collectively ensure that the final human blood and blood components, human tissues and human cell ular therapy products consistently meet specifications.

While the Code describes benchmark practices that should be followed, alternative approaches are permitted provided it could be demonstrated that the intent of the Code is met in a timely and effectiv e manner in order to meet quality objectives. Although this Code covers all aspects of quality assurance systems and manufacture, it is not intended that any constraint should be placed upon the development or introduction of new concepts or technologies. It is acknowledged that there can be acceptable alternatives conforming to the same basic principles and achieving the same end. The manufacturer bears the ultimate responsibility for the products it manufactures.

Comments on the Code are therefore invited at any stage of the life of this edition. Quality management Principle 100. Quality management is that aspect of the overall management function, which directs and controls an organisation with regard to quality. This should include every aspect of manufacture to ensure that the qualit y objectives will always be achieved. – A quality system should be established, documented, implemented and maintained to ensure that finished products are safe, are of appropriate quality, and meet regulatory requirements. The quality system should take int o account the appropriate elements outlined in the Code and incorporate risk management principles. – The fundamental concepts of Quality Assurance, Good Manufacturing Practice and Quality Control are inter -related and are described in the Code to emphasise their interaction and their primary importance to the production and control of therapeutic products. General 101. The quality system should provide a structured and organised approach for quality to be achieved . There should be resources at all levels to enable objectives to be met effectively. 102. The organisation’s quality policy should be defined and m anagement should take measures to ensure that the quality policy is understood, implemented and maintained at all levels of the organisation. 103. Management should def ine objectives pertaining to the quality, s afety , efficacy, and applicable regulatory and legal requirements. Procedures should be available to detail how these objectives are to be met. 104. The system of Quality Assurance appropriate for the manufacture of pr oducts should ensure that: – therapeutic products are designed and developed in a way that takes account of the requirements of this Code ; – production and control operations are clearly specified and Good Manufacturing Practice adopted; – managerial responsibi lities are clearly specified; – arrangements are made for the manufacture, supply and use of the correct starting and packaging", "version_id": "8ebeccc00664db4e", "ingested_at": 1760488329}

Documented procedures to ensure that deviations from the quality system, test procedures and manufac turing procedures are recorded, investigated and approved should be established maintained and implemented. 106. An autho rised person within the quality unit should approve deviations and any action taken. 107. If applicable, corrective or preventive action should be taken to eliminate the cause of nonconformities in order to prevent recurrence or occurrence. Measurement and monitoring 108. The quality system should be reviewed to ensure ongoing effectiveness and to identify any improvements needed. 109. A program for self -inspection should be established, documented and implemented to per iodically assess the effectiveness of the qualit y system. 110. Selection of auditors and conduct of self -inspections should ensure objectivity and impartiality. Auditors should not audit their own work. 111. Self-inspections should be recorded. Reports should include observations made during the inspections and , where applicable, proposals for corrective measures. Records of the subsequent actions should be maintained. 112. There should be procedures for the ongoing management and review of the corrective actions to ensure timely and effective implementation. 113. Regular periodic quality reviews of all products should be conducted with the objective of verifying the consistency of process es and the appropriateness of current specifications for both starting materials and finished product .

The Governance & Regulatory Affairs team currently f aces an unprecedented operational challenge, manually reviewing more than 50 documents for every Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) across over 2,600 assessments annually. Each assessment requires up to eight days to complete, creating significant bottlene cks and resulting in an estimated $8 million in annual productivity losses. This project proposes developing an AI -powered Regulatory Impact Assessment Assistant, designed as a secure chatbot embedded within Lifeblood's internal website. The system will enable employees to input change -related queries and receive rapid, AI -generat ed regulatory interpretations grounded in current Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) requirements. Initially operating under supervised conditions with human expert oversight, the system will progressively transition toward greater automation for routi ne assessments while maintaining human authority for complex regulatory decisions. The anticipated transformation includes reducing assessment turnaround times from eight days to less than one day, achieving cost savings of approximately $8 million annually, significantly reducing workload pressure on regulatory staff, and enhancing orga nisational agility in responding to regulatory changes. This represents a strategic investment positioning Lifeblood as a leader in regulatory technology adoption within the Australian healthcare sector. Client and Background Australian Red Cross Lifeblood serves as Australia's national blood service, operating as a critical component of the country's healthcare infrastructure. The organisation collects, processes, and supplies blood and biological products to hospitals nationw ide while contributing to biomedical research and diagnostic services. Given the life -critical nature of these operations, Lifeblood operates under stringent Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)", "version_id": "bb38d17f5e52f37f", "ingested_at": 1760488330}

Lifeblood has established a sophisticated technology environment providing a strong foundation for AI integration. Their Microsoft -centric infrastructure includes the Power Platform ecosystem (PowerBI, Power Automate, PowerApps), Microsoft AI Services (Azu re GPT, Copilot Studio, AI Studio), and AWS Bedrock for scalable AI experimentation. This technological sophistication indicates organisational readiness for advanced AI implementation. From a management perspective, Lifeblood applies design thinking principles and the Double Diamond framework, ensuring problem exploration precedes solution development. The organisation operates under Agile project management principles, enabling rapid fe edback cycles and iterative development. This methodological alignment creates favourable conditions for AI assistant development. The regulatory challenge emerges from the intersection of increasing regulatory complexity and organisational growth. The Governance & Regulatory Affairs team, led by Andrew [Last Name], comprises eight highly experienced professionals with 184 years of co mbined regulatory expertise. However, this concentrated expertise creates both a strategic asset and potential vulnerability, as capacity constraints limit organisational responsiveness to regulatory changes and business improvement initiatives. Problem Statement The current Regulatory Impact Assessment process represents a critical organisational bottleneck extending far beyond the Governance & Regulatory Affairs team, creating systemic inefficiencies that impact strategic decision -making, operational improvements , and organisational competitiveness. The manual review approach, while historically effective, has become fundamentally unsustainable given increasing regulatory complexity and frequency of updates. The primary inefficiency manifests in requiring manual review of more than 50 documents per assessment, with each evaluation cycle consuming approximately eight days of professional time. This translates to over 20,800 annual workdays devoted to regulatory assessment activities, representing substantial allocation of scarce professional expertise to routine analytical tasks. The eight -member team faces an average workload exceeding 325 assessments per professional annually, creating unsustainable pressure r isking quality degradation and staff burnout. Resource strain encompasses both quantitative workload measures and qualitative challenges in maintaining consistency across assessments. Manual approaches inherently introduce variation in analytical focus, depth, and interpretation, potentially creating compliance risks and reducing predictability of assessment outcomes. Knowledge vulnerability represents strategic risk, as regulatory expertise remains concentrated within a small professional team, creating dependencies that could become critical during s taff unavailability or organisational growth.", "version_id": "bb38d17f5e52f37f", "ingested_at": 1760488330}

B eyond financial measures, the current process delays innovation initiatives, slows strategic decision implementation, and reduces Lifeblood's capacity to respond rapidly to regulatory changes or market opportunities. Project Aims Primary Aim The fundamental objective is to design, develop, and implement a sophisticated Regulatory Impact Assessment Assistant that transforms compliance evaluation from an eight -day manual review cycle to rapid, AI -powered analysis completed in less than one day, while maintaining or enhancing regulatory accuracy, thoroughness, and compliance assurance. The system will be architected as a secure, conversational chatbot integrated within Lifeblood's internal website infrastructure, ensuring exclusive access to authorised employees while maintaining data security and regulatory compliance. The assistant wil l provide rapid, AI-powered responses to regulatory queries, supported by comprehensive human oversight mechanisms during initial implementation phases. Secondary Aims Employee Access and Usability Enhancement: Prioritise intuitive user experience through seamless chatbot integration within existing website infrastructure, ensuring employees across various technical proficiency levels can efficiently access regulatory guidance without extensive training. Advanced Document Analysis Capabilities: Incorporate state -of-the-art generative AI capabilities specifically optimised for interpreting complex TGA regulatory texts, internal compliance protocols, and cross -referenced regulatory frameworks. Flexible Integration Architecture: Design for seamless integration with Microsoft Power Platform components while maintaining architectural flexibility for future adaptations and potential integration with other organisational systems.

{"source": "REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT ASSISTANT.pdf", "page": 6, "text": "5 Methodology and Data Strategy Approaches Under Consideration The project team is engaging stakeholders through comprehensive discovery workshops and feasibility analysis to evaluate three distinct solution pathways. The final implementation may adopt a single approach or incorporate hybrid elements based on stakehol der requirements, technical feasibility, and performance optimization outcomes. Solution 1: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vector Database This approach combines semantic retrieval capabilities with advanced generative AI to provide accurate, contextually grounded responses to regulatory queries. The system stores regulatory documents as high -dimensional vector embeddings within a specialised semantic database, enabling meaning -based rather than keyword -based document retrieval. The RAG pipeline operates through semantic query analysis, where user queries are converted into vector embeddings and compared against comprehensive document embeddings through cosine similarity calculations. The augmentation phase dynamically injects rel evant retrieved document chunks into AI prompt context, ensuring responses remain grounded in actual regulatory content. The generation phase synthesises comprehensive responses integrating retrieved content with contextual interpretation while maintaining complete traceability through automatic source citations. Benefits: Ensures consistently up -to-date responses by accessing current regulatory documents at query time, demonstrates excellent scalability for large document collections exceeding 20GB, and provides crucial explainability through automatic citation generation supporting compliance accountability. Challenges: Requires sophisticated document chunking strategies balancing contextual coherence with retrieval precision, careful embedding model selection impacting both accuracy and computational requirements, and extensive testing to optimise retrieval thresholds. Solution 2: Semantic Knowledge Assistant (Information -Focused) This solution combines semantic retrieval and structured generation to give staff quick, accurate answers to operational or regulatory questions. Instead of relying on keyword matching, the system understands the meaning of user queries and connects them t o the most relevant information stored in a clause -level knowledge base. All documents are broken down into smaller, searchable sections and stored in a semantic index. Each section is converted into a vector embedding (a numerical representation of meaning), which allows the system to perform similarity searches when a user as ks a question. Queries are also converted into embeddings, and the system retrieves the closest - matching document sections using cosine similarity or other ranking methods.", "version_id": "bb38d17f5e52f37f", "ingested_at": 1760488330}

{"source": "REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT ASSISTANT.pdf", "page": 7, "text": "6 In the augmentation stage, the retrieved sections are injected into the context of the chatbot’s response. The chatbot then generates a short information card 3 to 5 clear bullet points summarising the key points directly from the retrieved text. To ensure traceability and trust, each answer automatically includes citations showing which document sections the information came from, along with version and source references. The pipeline also includes confidence thresholds and safety rules. If the system is not confident, or if the query is ambiguous, it will ask a clarifying follow up question or escalate to a human team member instead of guessing. All interactions are stored with audit logs for accountability, and the document library is version -controlled so that older answers remain reproducible even after documents are updated. Solution 3: Rule -Based + GenAI/NLP System The Hybrid Rule -Based + GenAI/NLP approach combines the deterministic reliability of rule - based compliance checks with the flexibility and summarisation power of generative AI. In this system, regulations are first codified into structured rules by subject matter experts (SMEs), which form the foundation for hard compliance checks. At the same time, regulatory documents are ingested, chunked, and indexed for semantic retrieval, allowing a generative AI model to provide natural language answers, summaries, a nd contextual insights. The chatbot thus delivers both: A structured compliance checklist (Pass/Fail/Flag, with explicit rules and citations). A narrative summary generated by AI, highlighting key obligations, risks, and gaps. This hybrid design ensures that outputs are both auditable and user -friendly, addressing the need for regulatory accuracy while also improving efficiency. Benefits Auditability and Trust: Every compliance decision is traceable to a specific rule and regulation section. Flexibility: GenAI can handle ambiguous queries, varied phrasing, and large unstructured documents. Efficiency: Rules automate repetitive checks, while AI provides summaries and explanations for faster decision -making. SME Alignment: Rules can be refined with SME input, while GenAI makes outputs more accessible for everyday staff. Balanced Risk: Provides predictable outputs where it matters (rules) while allowing AI assistance in grey areas. Drawbacks Setup Overhead: Requires SMEs to codify rules initially, which can be labour -intensive. Maintenance Burden: Rules must be regularly updated as regulations change.", "version_id": "bb38d17f5e52f37f", "ingested_at": 1760488330}

This report reflects our unified efforts to safeguard public health through best-practice regulation, continuous innovation and strong stakeholder engagement. It highlights how we have adapted to emerging health challenges while ensuring the safety, efficacy, performance and quality of therapeutic goods, in alignment with national and international standards. In 2023-24, the TGA demonstrated a consistent focus on strengthening regulatory effectiveness, ensuring timely access to life-saving products, and enhancing public confidence in Australia’s regulatory frameworks. Our work this year was driven by a commitment to improving compliance, advancing digital transformation, and supporting healthcare innovation. Through strong domestic and international collaboration, we maintained and strengthened Australia’s reputation as a global leader in health products regulation. Key achievements: • Regulation of vaping products: The TGA took a leading role in the delivery of the Australian Government’s comprehensive range of measures to reduce the harms from vaping, culminating in the Therapeutic Goods and Other Legislation Amendment (Vaping Reforms) Act 2024 commencing on 1 July 2024. These reforms include the prohibition of non-therapeutic vapes and the introduction of strengthened product standards and controls for therapeutic vapes. Between January and June 2024, working with the Australian Border Force (ABF) and the states and territories, we seized over 650,000 illicit nicotine vapes and the issuing of a number of fines. • Medicines Repurposing Program: Launched in March 2024, this program provides incentives for exploring new therapeutic uses for existing medicines to address unmet clinical needs where commercial incentives are limited. The program has seen strong engagement from clinicians, health organisations, and pharmaceutical companies, reinforcing the TGA’s leadership in driving healthcare innovation.", "version_id": "6dd05bc9d80ed88b", "ingested_at": 1760488335}

These reforms, supported by updated guidance documents and the further development of the Australian Unique Device Identification Database (AusUDID), are the building blocks for a strengthened approach to safety and traceability of medical devices in Australia. • Recognition as a World Health Organization (WHO) Listed Authority (WLA): As part of our commitment to global health, the TGA continues to strengthen international collaborations through the Regulatory Strengthening Program (RSP). In 2024, the TGA submitted an expression of interest to become a WLA, which will further enhance our role in upholding global regulatory standards for medicines and vaccines. • Digital transformation and modernisation: The TGA advanced its digital transformation with the launch of a new business portal for sponsors and manufacturers, streamlining submission processes and enhancing regulatory transparency and efficiency. Preparatory work to implement a new Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) also progressed, laying the groundwork for improved operational efficiency in the future. Stakeholder engagement remains central to the TGA’s strategic direction, focusing on meaningful interactions to foster trust and collaboration. Insights from the 2024 TGA Stakeholder Survey, conducted in July 2024, showed a 7% increase in public confidence, with 72% of health professionals and 62% of consumers affirming the TGA’s ability to balance safety with timely access to therapeutic goods. This year, we expanded our engagement across industry, consumer groups and government stakeholders, aligning Australia’s regulatory frameworks with global best practice. Our collaborative initiatives, including public consultations, targeted forums and strategic partnerships, have strengthened transparency and inclusivity, empowering stakeholders to shape regulatory reforms and ensuring our regulatory system remains responsive to evolving healthcare challenges. During the 2025-26 period, the TGA will focus on advancing regulatory reforms and strengthening compliance frameworks, particularly to address the use of unapproved therapeutic goods. This includes enhancing oversight of their import, export and supply, supporting industry through reform initiatives, and modernising regulatory processes to improve efficiency and transparency. Key activities will also include collaboration with domestic and international stakeholders, such as the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra), to ensure safe and effective practices,", "version_id": "6dd05bc9d80ed88b", "ingested_at": 1760488335}

We help Australians to stay safe by regulating therapeutic goods for safety, efficacy, performance and quality. We regulate the advertising, manufacture, import, export and supply of: • prescription medicines • vaccines • non-prescription medicines • some sunscreens and complementary medicines, including vitamins, minerals, herbal and traditional medicines • medical devices, including relevant software • blood and blood products • cellular therapies • biologicals, and • other goods defined as therapeutic goods under the Act. Consistent with the Act, we: • apply scientific and clinical expertise to assess whether the benefits of a therapeutic good outweigh any risks to health and safety • assess the suitability of therapeutic goods for supply, import and export from Australia • regulate manufacturers of therapeutic goods to ensure they meet acceptable standards of manufacturing quality • assess the quality and compliance of therapeutic goods on the market, including through laboratory testing where appropriate, and • implement a range of regulatory actions that are proportionate to the potential risk arising from non-compliance or emerging safety concerns. We achieve this by applying risk-based processes for both pre-market assessment and post-market monitoring, as well as promoting regulatory compliance through clear and transparent decision-making, providing education and guidance, and using innovative technologies and ideas to streamline business functions.

Insights from the TGA Stakeholder Survey The TGA conducts an annual stakeholder survey to analyse and enable improvement of how we work with our stakeholders. In 2024, we surveyed 1,050 consumers, 205 health professionals and 1,589 stakeholders with a TGA Business Services (TBS) account, many of whom have roles directly associated with the medical products industry. In performance indicator 1.2, we assess our success at providing timely access to innovative therapies and emerging technologies that respond to public health needs. In our stakeholder survey, we asked respondents who were aware of the TGA to indicate whether they agree or disagree with the statement, ‘The TGA gets the balance right between safety for consumers and timely access to products’ . In the survey, 63% respondents with a TBS account agreed and 14% disagreed with the statement. The remaining respondents said they ‘neither agree nor disagree’ or were ‘not sure’ . Agreement is down almost 3% compared with the 2023 survey, while disagreement is up by just 1%. The majority of health professionals believe the TGA gets the balance right, with 72% agreeing and 9% disagreeing, with agreement and disagreement down 1% in this cohort compared to 2023. Among consumers, 62% agreed that the TGA gets the balance right, with 11% disagreeing. In this cohort, agreement is up 7% and disagreement is down 4% compared with the 2023 survey. While the results are positive overall, and a level of disagreement is expected given the broad range of therapeutic goods regulated by the TGA, we will continue working to ensure stakeholders understand our risk-based approach to regulation.

During 2023-24, the TGA worked closely with multiple stakeholders to strengthen the regulation and enforcement of vaping products. This included developing significant legislative reforms introducing new controls on the importation, domestic manufacture, and supply of vaping products to better protect public health, particularly for young people. The reforms support the TGA Business Plan’s objective of enhancing regulatory compliance and safeguarding Australians from harmful products. Key reforms under the Government’s vaping reforms include:Importation controls:As of 1 January 2024, the importation of disposable single-use vapes, irrespective of nicotine content or therapeutic claims, was prohibited, with limited exceptions. Additionally, from 1 March 2024, the importation of all other vaping products was restricted, requiring compliance with new product standards, an import licence and a permit. The personal importation scheme for all vaping products ceased to apply. Domestic regulatory measures:From 1 March 2024, stronger controls were applied to the manufacture and supply of therapeutic vaping goods in Australia, including enhanced requirements for pre-market notification and compliance with the new product standards. Legislative reforms and enforcement:Amendments to the Act, taking effect on 1 July 2024, introduced new offences related to the unlawful importation, manufacture, supply, commercial possession and advertising of vaping products. These changes will enable more robust enforcement actions with higher penalties for illicit supply, while enabling a health practitioner-led pathway for legitimate patient access. Seizure of illicit products:Between January and June 2024, over 650,000 suspected illicit nicotine vaping products (NVP) were seized by the TGA in collaboration with the ABF. This significant enforcement activity reflects the enhanced powers provided by the new reforms. Establishing a medicines repurposing function We established a dedicated function to identify and validate new therapeutic uses for existing medicines, driven by research and evidence-based approaches. Following extensive public and targeted consultations from 2021 to 2023, the Medicines Repurposing Program commenced on 1 March 2024. This program is funded through the 2023-24 Federal Budget’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme reforms package and is scheduled to run until 30 June 2027.", "version_id": "6dd05bc9d80ed88b", "ingested_at": 1760488335}

The evaluation of these nominations focuses on unmet clinical need and access barriers, particularly where there is limited commercial incentive for sponsors to pursue regulatory approval. Discussions with sponsors of candidate medicines from the initial tranche of nominations are ongoing. As we advance, we will continue to collaborate with stakeholders to refine and improve program processes, ensuring that our approach remains responsive to the evolving needs in the field of medicine repurposing. Recall reforms Continue the design and implementation of reforms to improve recall actions for all therapeutic goods During 2023-24, we implemented several key reforms following the analysis of stakeholder responses to our public consultation, Therapeutic Goods Recall Processes – Discussion Paper. Based on stakeholder feedback, we prioritised the following actions: • reduced regulatory burden by streamlining unnecessary steps in the recall process • ensured recall letters and notices are clear and concise, with key information prominently displayed for quick understanding by customers and end users • enhanced transparency in our recall processes, including clearer guidelines on the timing for releasing recall information and the hazard classification process for recall actions • updated recall document templates to reflect best practices • transition from a Customer Acknowledgement Form to a Customer Response Form, incorporating modern tools such as QR codes and online survey links to improve customer response rates to sponsor recall letters, and • providing sponsors with the opportunity to review Early Advice Notices before seeking feedback from stakeholders on recall actions. In support of these recommendations, we implemented changes to recall processes and enhanced the clarity and accessibility of our guidance and resource materials. These reforms were introduced through the new version of the Uniform Recall Procedure for Therapeutic Goods (URPTG) Version 2.4 , and included updates to the recall information provided through our website.

Reviewing medical device safety and performance Throughout 2023-24, we conducted numerous post-market reviews of a range of medical devices to assess their continued safety and performance. This work included reviews of home-use foetal dopplers, ventilators, sleep apnoea devices, spinal cord stimulators, plastic syringes, HIV nucleic acid tests and neonatal incubators. Following these reviews, action was taken to remove all 9 home-use foetal dopplers from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) due to the risks associated with unsupervised use. We also identified and cancelled 12 non-compliant spinal cord stimulator (SCS) devices from the ARTG and imposed stringent conditions on 45 other (SCS) devices to improve their ongoing safety and performance. We also continued to closely monitor emerging health threats including avian influenza, proactively assessing the suitability of in vitro diagnostic devices to detect these evolving strain variants. Strengthening pharmacovigilance and vaccine evaluationWe expanded our pharmacovigilance efforts to include comprehensive monitoring of newly registered vaccines and other high-priority products. This included focused surveillance on Shingrix following its inclusion in the National Immunisation Program (NIP), as well as the recently approved Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccines, AREXVY and ABRYSVO, and the RSV monoclonal antibody Beyfortus. This coordinated approach enabled timely detection of safety signals and implementation of appropriate regulatory actions to maintain public confidence in these critical therapeutic products. Additionally, we undertook thorough investigations into glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as Ozempic (semaglutide), resulting in product label updates and regulatory interventions to address potential risks to the community. Priortising the evaluation and laboratory testing of new products The TGA prioritised the evaluation and approval of COVID-19 vaccines, including those containing the new XBB.1.5 strain, as well as novel RSV vaccines, to ensure they met safety, efficacy and quality standards.

Through the following coordinated efforts, the TGA has reinforced its commitment to facilitating continuous patient access to essential therapeutic goods. Our proactive approach to managing medicine and medical device shortages, in collaboration with key stakeholders, has strengthened our ability to respond swiftly to supply disruptions and mitigate their impact on public health Medicine shortagesBuilding on the legislative amendments made in 2022-23 to provide additional access pathways to alleviate the effects of medicine shortages, the TGA continues to strategically manage medicine shortages using a range of mechanisms, including stakeholder engagement and partnerships. Medicine shortages management: The TGA continued to improve management actions and strategies for monitoring and addressing shortages of important medicines. This included convening multiple Medicine Shortages Action Group (MSAG) meetings to address high-impact shortages. Each MSAG is a short-term working group that brings together health professionals, consumer representatives and relevant stakeholders to provide clinical shortage management strategies. Coordination of Medicine Availability Working Group (MAWG): The MAWG, consisting of representatives from state and territory health departments and expert advisers, met monthly to discuss medicines of concern and provide expertise on supply and demand forecasting. This group played a key role in monitoring and managing shortages of critical medicines, ensuring ongoing availability for patients. Dynamic Model of Medicine Availability: We developed a new Dynamic Model of Medicine Availability to forecast the availability of hospital medicines under various scenarios. This modelling enabled us to collaborate with stakeholders in hospital settings to predict and manage medicine shortages more effectively, especially during critical supply disruptions. Data sharing for hospital medicine shortages: In 2023-24, we progressed a targeted consultation on a data-sharing framework to improve the management of serious hospital medicine shortages.

Effective from 1 July 2023, the TGA rescheduled psilocybin and MDMA from Schedule 9 (prohibited substances) to Schedule 8 (controlled drugs) of the Poisons Standard, specifically for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). For all other uses, these substances remain classified as Schedule 9 and are restricted to use in clinical trials. T o ensure the safety and efficacy of these treatments, we also developed draft quality standards for MDMA and psilocybin, specifying the minimum quality requirements for both the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and the finished products. These quality standards aim to ensure consistency in the products supplied to Australian patients, supporting the known safety and therapeutic outcomes. Quality standards developmentThe draft standards for MDMA and psilocybin were developed with input from companies manufacturing these substances for clinical trials, ensuring that the proposed requirements reflect current methodologies and testing limits for both the API and finished products (e.g. capsules). T o gather broader stakeholder input, a public consultation was held between 8 December 2023 and 31 January 2024. Stakeholders, including manufacturers, peak health organisations, medical practitioners, pharmacists and patients, provided feedback with broad in-principle support for the proposed standards. Several minor technical changes were suggested and are now under review. Authorised Prescriber (AP) schemeUnder the TGA’s AP scheme, registered psychiatrists can prescribe MDMA and psilocybin for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression and PTSD. T o become an AP, medical practitioners must receive approval from a Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) under a defined treatment protocol. Once approved, psychiatrists are required to report biannually to the TGA on the number of patients treated with these unapproved products.

Launching TGA Learn for regulatory education We launched TGA Learn, an education initiative providing self-paced and structured learning opportunities for enterprises, researchers and industry to better understand regulatory and legislative obligations. T o help support and educate start-ups, researchers and small-to-medium enterprises on how to navigate the regulatory pathway, we launched the TGA Learn service. TGA Learn provides a self-paced learning model for industry engagement and education through 4 pillars-self-paced online education, structured online learning events, targeted in-person events, and strategic partnerships. Through TGA Learn, we expanded our engagement with universities, incubators, industry and other government organisations to develop and deliver education sessions for businesses and individuals to understand their regulatory obligations within the therapeutic goods landscape. In 2023-24, this included the CSIRO’s Innovate to Grow Program aimed at helping small to medium sized businesses learn about collaborative research and development, and the NSW Health Commercialisation T raining Program to build foundational commercialisation knowledge and skills in those working on medtech and biotech innovations.

Insights from the TGA Stakeholder Survey For performance measures 3.1 and 3.2, we assess our success at promoting regulatory compliance and addressing serious, deliberate and repeated non-compliance. Three statements were included in the TGA stakeholder survey to measure perceptions of our compliance and enforcement activities. The first related specifically to the TGA’s enforcement of advertising regulations. Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement or disagreement with the statement: ‘The TGA takes strong action against illegal advertising for health products’ . Agreement with this statement was 63% for consumers (the same as last year), 62% for stakeholders with a TBS account (down 4%), and 71% for health professionals. A second statement aimed to measure perceptions of the full range of the TGA’s enforcement actions- ‘The TGA takes strong action against illegal behaviour’ . Agreement with this statement was 63% for consumers (up 3%), 67% for TBS account holders (down 3%), and 68% for health professionals. A third statement gauged whether respondents believe the TGA takes action against serious non- compliance and repeat offenders: ‘I am confident the TGA addresses serious, deliberate and repeated non-compliance’ .

These results highlight both areas of confidence and opportunities to enhance stakeholder understanding of our compliance activities. Improving compliance with regulatory requirements We improved compliance with therapeutic goods regulations by delivering targeted educational programs that helped businesses and individuals understand and meet legal obligations. In 2023-24, we launched public awareness campaigns, and implemented enforcement actions, all aimed at assisting businesses and individuals to meet their obligations under the Act. T o support regulatory changes announced in May 2024 concerning compounded GLP-1 RA products, such as semaglutide, we published updated information for consumers and health professionals. This provided essential details about the changes, along with links to further resources. A webinar was also held in August 2024, prior to the changes becoming effective on 1 October 2024, to further assist stakeholders in understanding the regulatory updates and how to comply with the new rules. In response to increasing concerns about advertising compliance for cosmetic injectables, we published updated advertising guidance and educational materials. The new guidelines sought to achieve consistency in advertising regulations across all industries that deal with therapeutic goods. These changes were also driven by concerns over the vulnerability of Australians to the advertising of non-surgical cosmetic procedures. T o support industry stakeholders a webinar was held in April 2024, explaining the rationale behind the changes, and further educational support was provided through a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page published in May 2024 to address common industry queries. Given the rise in advertising compliance issues related to medicinal cannabis, we released further guidance to assist businesses in navigating regulatory requirements for this category of products. In December 2023, we launched a targeted educational campaign aimed at content creators and influencers on social media, educating them on the rules around promoting therapeutic goods online. This campaign, which ran on Meta and Instagram, reached over 1 million people within a 2 week period, effectively raising awareness of the advertising rules for therapeutic goods in the digital space.

These efforts supported our broader goal of improving public health and safety through enhanced understanding and adherence to legal obligations. Compliance monitoring of listed medicines In 2023-24, we continued to prioritise key areas of non-compliance for listed medicines, focusing on activities that safeguard the integrity of the post-market regulatory framework and consumer safety. Our targeted compliance efforts centered on the following types of non-compliance of concern: • insufficient evidence to support efficacy • advertising indications not included on the ARTG • missing mandatory warning statements • failure to meet restrictions required by the Permissible Ingredients Determination, particularly monitoring component quantity restrictions • obvious relisting non-compliances, and • investigating sponsors with a history of consistent non-compliance. These areas of non-compliance were identified as priorities due to their potential to pose significant risks to public health and the overall regulatory framework.

This early engagement allowed sponsors to address compliance issues in a timely manner, receiving positive feedback as they avoided potential commercial risks or losses. Our targeted reviews for 2023-24 included medicines containing Artemisia species, molluscs, and Bacillus coagulans, all of which require mandatory warning statements. We also conducted efficacy assessments of medicines containing colecalciferol (Vitamin D) for bone health claims, lysine hydrochloride for managing cold sores, and listed sports supplements containing magnesium in relation to enhancing muscle or exercise performance.We also targeted medicines where the name or indications did not align with the permissible indications listed in their ARTG entries, and we focused on sponsors with a history of non-compliance.In 2023-24, we took a total of 483 compliance and enforcement actions, ranging from educational initiatives, such as mass email education, to higher-level actions, including infringement notices and recalls. On average, 60-70% of the medicines targeted with low-level actions were brought into compliance, reaching at least 14% of sponsors across the listed medicines sector. Delivering risk-based compliance and enforcement activities We implemented risk-based, intelligence-informed compliance activities to ensure that the import, manufacture, advertising, and supply of therapeutic goods met regulatory standards. In 2023-24, the TGA conducted targeted, risk-based compliance and enforcement activities to address the unlawful importation, advertising and supply of nicotine vaping products. These actions were guided by intelligence gathering and close collaboration with health and law enforcement agencies across Australia. These efforts align with the TGA’s strategic focus on maintaining compliance with regulatory standards and protecting public health. Intelligence and collaborationThe TGA gathered intelligence to identify non-compliance and worked closely with health and law enforcement agencies. This collaboration enabled a coordinated response to the unlawful importation and supply of nicotine vaping products.

The Federal Court of Australia ordered the company and its director to pay $5 million in combined penalties for unlawfully advertising nicotine vaping products, setting a strong precedent for regulatory enforcement. These efforts reinforced the TGA’s commitment to ensuring compliance with the import, manufacture, advertising and supply requirements of therapeutic goods under the Act. By focusing on intelligence-informed and risk-based activities, the TGA effectively addressed unlawful practices and protected public health. Strengthening compliance and enforcement through multi-channel detection and collaborative efforts Throughout the 2023-24 financial year, non-compliance was identified through many channels, including community reports/complaints, advice from other regulators and agencies, including state and territory regulators and border and law enforcement bodies. Analysis of therapeutic goods industries and observed non-compliance trends also supported the identification of further non-compliant incidences. We utilise a risk-based approach to prioritise reports of non-compliance and take appropriate action. We have continued to work closely with domestic and international agencies to detect, intercept and investigate unlawful therapeutic goods imported into Australia. Our strong partnership with the ABF has remained critical in building an effective compliance program. While reports and case volumes for alleged non-compliance are consistent, the TGA referred a significantly higher volume of goods to the ABF for destruction following assessment in the 2023-24 financial year. A large portion of these were nicotine products. The TGA consistently monitors online content for unlawful advertising and/or supply of therapeutic goods via web platforms. The TGA has continued to work closely with several digital platforms, including Meta, TikT ok and Amazon, to deter and address advertising of unapproved therapeutic goods. When alleged unlawful advertisements on social media are identified, we alert the social media platform, which typically takes action promptly in line with their user policies. This continued growth in digital platform monitoring has seen close to 5,000 requests for removal of content made to digital platforms in the 2023-24 financial year. In December 2023, the TGA established a framework to enhance protection for Australians from unlawful online content.

Provisional approval is granted for promising new medicines where we assess that the benefit of early availability of the medicine outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.

If an ingredient or indication is not included in the Determinations, an application for a new ingredient or indication needs to be made. Unlike registered medicines, we do not assess each listed medicine before it goes onto the market. However, we do require sponsors to certify that the medicine complies with all relevant legislation, and that they hold evidence at the time of listing (and at all times) that their medicine does what it says it will. We may select a listed medicine for a post-market review where we require the sponsor to provide evidence of compliance with regulatory requirements.

Signals of potential non-compliances, which include those captured by ARTG scanning, as well as those gathered from complaints and referrals from external or internal stakeholders, are triaged and assessed for the level of risk they pose. Based on these assessments, the appropriate actions are meted to each signal of non-compliance. Low risk signals may be addressed with education correspondence, whereas signals which may pose a higher risk may result in an in-depth investigation being conducted. Depending on the risks, some signals may result in medium to high level compliance or enforcement actions such as a warning letter, a compliance review or infringement notices. T argeted compliance reviews may be initiated as a result of signals investigations or from intel/data that is available regarding a compliance topic. A compliance review will result in one of the following outcomes: • the review is concluded, and the medicine remains on the ARTG (e.g. if no compliance breaches are identified against selected listing requirements, or if identified compliance breaches are addressed) • the review leads to additional regulatory actions, such as cancellation from the ARTG, recall, or infringement notices being issued, and • The review is closed due to the unavailability of information in determining its compliance status (e.g. if the medicine is yet to be manufactured). Outcomes of all listed medicine compliance reviews, cancellations by the TGA, recall actions , infringement notices issued and advertising directions and prevention notices are published on the TGA website.

This may be through onsite inspections or desktop assessment of third-party inspection reports, or a combination of these methods. Surveillance inspections are also undertaken to assess continuing compliance. In addition, we are a Regulatory Authority of the Medical Devices Single Audit Program (MDSAP) that assesses and recognises third party Auditing Organisations for the purposes of certifying medical device manufacturers. We also conduct ‘for-cause’ audits of some manufacturers, regardless of what type of certification they use to support approval in Australia, if we have strong postmarket concerns. Conformity assessment: This is the systematic examination by the manufacturer to determine that a medical device is safe and performs as intended and therefore, conforms to the Essential Principles. The TGA may certify the manufacturer’s conformity assessment procedure, or we may recognise certification from a comparable overseas regulator such as a European notified body. Inclusion in the ARTG: Medical devices cannot be imported, supplied in, or exported from Australia unless they are included in the ARTG or a valid exemption applies, for example custom made medical devices, importation of samples, etc. A sponsor can apply to include a medical device in the ARTG if the device complies with the Essential Principles and appropriate conformity assessment procedures have been applied to the device. Post-market monitoring: Once a medical device has been included in the ARTG the device must continue to meet all regulatory, quality, safety and performance requirements throughout the claimed lifespan. 8�1 Conformity assessment Applications T able 37: Number of conformity assessment applications (medical devices including IVDs) FY 2022-23 FY 2023-24 Conformity assessment applications Applications received 202 96 Applications on hand 119 161 Applications completed (including withdrawn or lapsed applications). 204 204", "version_id": "6dd05bc9d80ed88b", "ingested_at": 1760488335}

Category B is an application pathway which can be accessed by health practitioners for patients who do not fit the Category A definition. An approval letter from the TGA is required before the goods may be accessed. Category C is a notification pathway which allows health practitioners to supply goods that are deemed to have an established history of use without first seeking prior approval. The goods deemed to have an established history of use are specified in a list along with their indications and the type of health practitioner authorised to supply these products. Any unapproved therapeutic good can potentially be supplied via the SAS although drugs listed in Schedule 9 of the Poisons Standard are forbidden from supply in most states and territories.", "version_id": "6dd05bc9d80ed88b", "ingested_at": 1760488335}
